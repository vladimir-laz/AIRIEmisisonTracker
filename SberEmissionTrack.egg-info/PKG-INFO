Summary: # SberEmisisonTracker  ## Requirements SberEmissionTrack need to get util-linux in order to work correctly on linux.   ##  Installation As this project is still under development, in order to utilize SberEmisisonTrack correctly please run  ```bash pip uninstall SberEmissionTrack -y ``` before the installation  Next step to install the package is to run the following command in your terminal: ```bash pip install git+git://github.com/vladimir-laz/AIRIEmisisonTracker.git ``` In order to all dependencies to be set correctly you may need to restart your kernel after package installation ## Use example SberEmissionTrack's interface is quite simple. Here is a the most straightforward usage example ```python  import SberEmissionTrack.Tracker  tracker = Tracker() tracker.start()  *your gpu &(or) cpu calculations*  tracker.stop() ```  There is [sber_emission_tracker_guide.ipynb](https://github.com/vladimir-laz/AIRIEmisisonTracker/blob/704ff88468f6ad403d69a63738888e1a3c41f59b/guide/sber_emission_tracker_guide.ipynb)  - useful jupyter notebook with more examples and notes. We highly recommend to check it out beforehand. ## Important note In order to calculate gpu & cpu power consumption correctly you should create the 'Tracker' before any gpu or cpu usage  For every new calculation create a new “Tracker.”  # Feedback If you had some problems while working with our tracker, please, give us a feedback comments in [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1927TwoFaW7R_IFC6-4xKG_sjlPUaYCX9vLqzrOsASB4/edit#gid=0)
